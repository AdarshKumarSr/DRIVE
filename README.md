# Project Name

**Description:**  
This project is a file management system built with **Node.js** for the backend, **EJS** for the frontend, and **JWT-based user authentication**. It allows users to securely upload, store, update, and delete their files, with each user having a unique account for managing their data.

## Features
- **User Authentication (JWT)**: Secure user registration, login, and session management using **JWT** for token-based authentication.
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload files to the server.
- **File Storage**: Files are securely stored and linked to each authenticated user.
- **Update Files**: Users can update or replace their existing files.
- **Delete Files**: Users can delete files from their account.
- **Simple UI**: Built with **EJS** templates for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- **Secure Data**: All file operations are performed only when the user is authenticated via JWT.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication and session management
- **File Management**: Upload, update, and delete files functionality
- **Database**: (If applicable, mention here)
- **Local Storage**: For temporarily storing file-related data in the browser (if applicable)

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Ensure Node.js and npm are installed)
- (Mention any database or other dependencies if used, e.g., MongoDB for storing user data)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository_name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository_name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file to store environment variables, such as **JWT secret key**, database credentials, and other sensitive data.

5. Run the project:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `.env`).

## Usage

- **User Authentication**: Register for an account or log in using your credentials. Authentication is required to upload, update, or delete files. JWT is used for session management, and users must provide a valid token to perform file operations.
- **Upload Files**: Once logged in, go to the file upload page and select files to upload.
- **Update Files**: After logging in, modify or replace an uploaded file by selecting it from the list of your files.
- **Delete Files**: Remove files from your account using the delete option.

### Example Requests:
- **POST** `/login`: Log in and receive a JWT token.
- **POST** `/register`: Register a new user and receive a JWT token.
- **GET** `/files`: View a list of files (requires JWT token).
- **POST** `/upload`: Upload a file (requires JWT token).
- **DELETE** `/files/:id`: Delete a file (requires JWT token).
